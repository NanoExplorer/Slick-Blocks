Colors do not match between rotations:
	For example:
	
	T does this:
	
	
	ooo
	 X
	 
	o
	Xo
	o
	
	 o
	oXo
	
	 o
	oX
	 o
	 
	 
	For Frivolousness' sake, I could rearrange the arrays to handle rotation for all cases (including O, whose colors always stay the same)
	To more closely clone Tetris's behavior, I could make all the squares in a TetraBlock the same color.


Finish the pause-game screen 
	clickable buttons:
	 - exit
	 - return to menu
	 - resume 
	
	
Handle line detection (*cough cough*)
	or give up and make anti-tetris
	

Scoring!

	Tetris:
		lines give you points.
		
	anti-tetris
		blocks give you points - higher y values = more points.
