Finish the pause-game screen 
	clickable buttons:
	 - exit
	 - return to menu
	 - resume 
	Pause menu is currently semi-functional
	I mean, at least it says "pause"

	or give up and make anti-tetris
	

Scoring!

	Tetris:
		lines give you points.
		
	anti-tetris
		blocks give you points - higher y values = more points.
